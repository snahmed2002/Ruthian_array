# Routh-Hurwitz Stability Calculator

A graphical application that uses the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to determine the stability of a control system. The user can enter the coefficients of a characteristic polynomial, and the app will generate the Routh array and display whether the system is stable or unstable.

## Features
- Calculate the Routh array from input polynomial coefficients.
- Detect stability based on sign changes in the first column of the Routh array.
- Display results in an intuitive graphical window.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**: Installable via pip.
- **Tkinter**: Usually included with Python installations.
